#Nosocks
---
Stupid project for choosing a gift for the new year, namely a variety of socks.
An example of this work is provided below:
<img src="./example.gif" width="33%" height="auto" />

The principle is based on code generation, based on the choice of a response in binary code. Under each code was a specific photo with socks.
  The generation algorithm in the file [Algoritm.java](/nosocks/blob/master/app/src/main/java/ppts/website/nosocks/Algoritm.java)

***The project was released for my University course***
